# 💻 Used Technologies

- ⚛️ ReactJS - Framework for creating modern, fluid and responsive design interfaces on multiple devices, using TypeScript;
- 🇳 NextJS - React framework for considerable improvement in page structure and to facilitate indexing and server side rendering (SSR);
- 💙 TypeScript - A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving better tools at any scale on applications;
- ⚖️ Mantine - A React components library that includes more than 120 customizable components and hooks;
- 💅 Styled Components - enhanced CSS for styling React component systems, used for styling the main components and pages.

## Getting Started

You can view the project directly in your browser by clicking [this link (Vercel deploy)](https://bouncy-trader.vercel.app/)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
